# Sorelle 2

Sorelle is a student project developed for the purpose of learning full stack web development. 

Learning goals:
* MVC Web Application
* ORM Framework
* Testing
* Responsive Design
* AJAX implementation *(not complete)*
  * Currently evaluating frameworks. I will most likely implement React.

## Features

Sorelle is a workflow based personal task manager. It supports tagging of tasks, divided into 5 categories of tags. New tasks are flagged with an "Inbox" status so they may be reviewed and tagged in bulk.

#### Tag Categories
* Priority
  * Examples: Immediate, Next, Queue, Soon
* Status
* Planning
  * Daily, Weekly, Seasonal, 2016
* Constraint
  * Internet required, At Home, At Work
* Other

## Future Plans
* AJAX for faster task management
* Calendar View
* Saved Searches
* Sharing tasks
* Snoozing tasks
* Recurring tasks
* User Defined Workflows
